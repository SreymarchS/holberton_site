            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m March! I’m an aspiring software developer transitioning from a registered nurse. I’ve always been
                fascinated by technology, and I’m now pursuing my dream of becoming a developer. I have completed
                Certificate III in Information Technology, where I’m learning software development through hands-on
                projects and peer collaboration. I’m an adventurous and enthusiastic person, always seeking new
                challenges and eager to expand my skill set. This passion for learning and exploring new opportunities
                is what drives my transition into software development, as I believe it’s the perfect field for me to
                grow, innovate, and continue my journey of discovery.</p>

            <h2>Learning and Skills</h2>
            <ul>

                <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>

                <p><strong>Tools & Frameworks:</strong> Git, Node.js, React (currently learning), Express</p>

                <p><strong>Problem Solving & Critical Thinking:</strong> You ensured precise patient care, similar
                    to
                    writing clean, bug-free code and conducting thorough testing in development.</p>

                <p><strong>Attention to detail:</strong> As a nurse, you made quick decisions to
                    ensure patient safety, which translates into troubleshooting and debugging code in software
                    development.</p>

                <p><strong>Team Collaboration & Communication:</strong> Working with medical teams has prepared you
                    for collaborating effectively with developers, designers, and PMs in tech environments.</p>

                <p><strong>Adapting to New Technologies:</strong> Just as you adapted to new medical equipment,
                    you’ll quickly learn new programming languages and technologies in development.</p>

                <p><strong>User-Centered Mindset:</strong> Prioritizing patient comfort and care translates into
                    designing user-friendly software that meets the needs of end-users.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why I Chose Software Development:</strong><br>
                        I’m passionate about technology and how it can solve real-world problems. As a scrub/scout
                        nurse, I developed a deep appreciation for precision, organization, and problem-solving. Whether
                        I was preparing instruments for a surgical procedure or assisting the surgeon, I learned how
                        important it is to be detail-oriented and proactive. These skills have naturally translated into
                        my journey toward software development, where the same focus on collaboration, planning, and
                        execution is crucial. I thrive in environments where I am continuously learning and developing
                        new skills. My background in healthcare, coupled with my passion for technology, motivates me to
                        bring a unique perspective to the tech world.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why Holberton School:</strong><br>
                        I chose Holberton School because of its unique, hands-on, project-based curriculum that
                        emphasizes learning through real-world applications. Holberton’s peer-driven approach and
                        focus on collaboration are incredibly appealing to me because I believe that learning from
                        others and solving complex problems together is the best way to prepare for a career in
                        tech. I am currently developing my skills in software engineering, and I’m excited to
                        continue growing as a developer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why PEXA?</strong><br>
                        I am deeply excited about the prospect of working at PEXA, a company that is transforming
                        the property settlement process. PEXA’s innovative approach to creating digital property
                        transactions resonates with my passion for technology and efficiency. While I’m still early
                        in my career, I’m eager to learn from PEXA’s forward-thinking team and contribute my skills
                        to their mission of simplifying and improving the real estate industry through technology.
                    </p>


                    <p><strong>Why the SHEE Program?</strong><br>
                        Being a woman in tech, I am passionate about empowering others and promoting diversity in
                        the STEM field. The SHEE Program is something I aspire to be part of because it focuses on
                        supporting women in engineering and entrepreneurship. I believe that diversity is key to
                        driving innovation, and the SHEE Program offers a platform for women to grow, lead, and
                        mentor others in the tech industry. By joining this program, I hope to continue building my
                        skills and contribute to fostering a more inclusive tech community.</p>
