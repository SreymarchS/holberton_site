            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m March! I’m an aspiring software developer transitioning from a registered nurse. I’ve always been
                fascinated by technology, and I’m now pursuing my dream of becoming a developer. I have completed
                Certificate III in Information technology, where I’m learning software development through hands-on
                projects and peer
                collaboration.</p>

            <h3>Learning and Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
                <li><strong>Tools & Frameworks:</strong> Git, Node.js, React (Currently learning)</li>
                <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Problem-solving, collaboration, critical thinking, time management
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Holberton School?</h3>
            <p>I chose Holberton School because of its project-based, peer-driven approach. I love the challenge of
                learning by doing and working with others to solve real-world problems. The school’s emphasis on
                building a strong foundation in computer science is exactly what I need to succeed as a developer.</p>

            <h3>What I’m Working On</h3>
            <p>While I’m still in the early stages of my journey, I’ve worked on some foundational projects like
                building simple websites and learning the basics of web development. I’m continuously learning and
                improving my skills, and I’m excited to start working on more complex projects in the near future.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As a Registered Nurse turned aspiring Software Engineer, I am passionate about using technology to
                improve
                healthcare. I’m currently on my journey at Holberton School to develop the skills needed to bridge the
                gap
                between healthcare and technology.</p>

            <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
            <p>Though I’ve only just begun my career in software development, I have big plans for the future. Some of
                my main
                goals include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Develop healthcare solutions:</strong> I want to build applications that help healthcare
                        providers
                        improve patient care and streamline their work processes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Combine healthcare and technology:</strong> I aim to work on projects that bridge the gap
                        between
                        healthcare and technology, making health services more accessible and efficient.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Start a healthcare tech startup:</strong> In the long term, I aspire to launch a tech
                        startup
                        focused on healthcare solutions that benefit both patients and healthcare professionals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Mentorship and teaching:</strong> I want to mentor others who want to combine healthcare
                        and
                        technology and teach future generations of healthcare workers how to use technology in their
                        careers.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
