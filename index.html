      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><strong>Hi, I'm March!</strong> I'm an aspiring software developer transitioning from a career as a registered
        nurse. I've
        always been fascinated by technology, and I'm now pursuing my dream of becoming a developer. I have completed
        a Certificate III in Information Technology, where I learned software development through hands-on
        projects and peer collaboration. I am also currently studying a Certificate IV in Cyber Security. I'm an
        adventurous and enthusiastic person, always seeking new
        challenges and eager to expand my skill set. This passion for learning and exploring new opportunities
        is what drives my transition into software development, as I believe it's the perfect field for me to
        grow, innovate, and continue my journey of discovery.</p>
      <h2>Experience and Skills</h2>
      <ul class="list-content">
        <li>
          <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Tools & Frameworks:</strong> Git, Node.js, Express, Shopify, Wordpress, React (currently learning).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Problem Solving & Critical Thinking:</strong> As a nurse, I had to react to patients and surgeons
            in complex, highly stressful environments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Attention to detail:</strong> As a nurse, I had to analyze and make informed decisions to ensure
            patient safety. This will translate well into gathering client requirements, troubleshooting and debugging
            code in software development projects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Team Collaboration & Communication:</strong> Working with medical teams has prepared me
            for collaborating effectively with others. This would naturally extend to clients, developers, designers,
            and PMs in tech environments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Adapting to New Technologies:</strong> I am a quick learner and have frequently adapted to new
            medical equipment. This will help me with learning new programming languages and technologies as a
            developer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>User-Centered Mindset:</strong> Prioritizing patient comfort and care is a priority of mine. This
            will help me to understand customer requirements and to design user-friendly software that meets the needs
            of end-users.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

          <ul class="list-content">
            <li>
              <p><strong>Why I Chose Software Development:</strong><br>
                I'm passionate about technology and how it can solve real-world problems. As a scrub/scout
                nurse, I developed a deep appreciation for precision, organization, and problem-solving. Whether
                I was preparing instruments for a surgical procedure or assisting the surgeon during the operation, I
                learned how important it is to be detail-oriented and proactive. These skills have helped with
                my journey into software development, where the same focus on collaboration, planning, and
                execution is crucial. I thrive in environments where I am continuously challenged, learning and
                developing new skills. My background in healthcare, coupled with my passion for technology, motivates me
                to bring a unique perspective to the tech world.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Why Holberton School:</strong><br>
                I chose Holberton School because of its unique, hands-on, project-based curriculum that
                emphasizes learning through real-world applications. Holberton's peer-driven approach and
                focus on collaboration are incredibly appealing to me because I believe that learning from
                others and solving complex problems together is the best way to prepare for a career in
                tech. I have enjoyed the application process and technical workshops and challenges.
                I am currently developing my skills in software engineering, and I'm excited to
                continue growing as a developer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Why PEXA?</strong><br>
                I am deeply excited about the prospect of working at PEXA, a company that is transforming
                the property settlement process. PEXA's innovative approach to creating digital property
                transactions resonates with my passion for technology and efficiency. While I'm still early
                in my career, I'm eager to learn from PEXA's forward-thinking team and contribute my skills
                to their mission of simplifying and improving the real estate industry through technology.
                I have also used the PEXA platform when I bought my house a few years ago. I found that the
                software was easy to use and made the settlement process much more clear and understandable.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Why the SHEE Program?</strong><br>
                Being a woman who is new to tech, I am passionate about empowering others and promoting diversity in
                the STEM field. The SHEE Program is something I aspire to be part of because it focuses on
                supporting women in engineering and entrepreneurship. I believe that diversity is key to
                driving innovation, and the SHEE Program offers a platform for women to grow, lead, and
                mentor others in the tech industry. By joining this program, I hope to continue building my
                skills and contribute to fostering a more inclusive tech community. This diversity amongst developers,
                designers and product managers means that there would be a wider range of ideas and visions within the
                team. This translates into software designs that are better thought out and takes into account more
                perspectives
